What does this script print?

a = (1, 2)
b = (1, 2)
a is b

False

why false?
Although a and b have the same values (1, 2), they are not referring to the same tuple object. Each time you define a tuple, a new object is created in memory. 
Therefore, a is b checks for object identity and returns False because a and b are different tuple objects, even though their contents are the same.
