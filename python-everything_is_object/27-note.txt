>>> id(a)
139926795932424
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a = a + [5]
>>> id(a)
Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? Answer with Yes or No.

No

why no?
The initial value of a is a list [1, 2, 3, 4], and its memory address (obtained using id(a)) is 139926795932424.
When you perform the operation a = a + [5], a new list is created by concatenating the existing list a with [5]. This creates a new object in memory. 
Therefore, the assignment a = a + [5] assigns the new list object to a, and the memory address of a will be different from the initial memory address.
