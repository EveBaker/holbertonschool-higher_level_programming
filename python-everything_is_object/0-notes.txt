why is the type function used?:
The type function in Python is used to determine the type or class of an object. It returns the type of the object as a value of the built-in type class. This function is particularly useful when you want to perform type checking or introspection in your code. 
By using the type function, you can identify the data type or class of an object and make decisions or perform operations based on that information.
