What does this script print?

l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = l1
l1.append(4)
print(l2)

[1, 2, 3, 4]

why is [1, 2, 3, 4] printed out
In the given code, l1 is assigned a list [1, 2, 3], and l2 is assigned the same list object as l1 using the assignment l2 = l1. Both l1 and l2 refer to the same list object in memory.
When l1.append(4) is executed, it modifies the list object referred to by l1 by appending the value 4 to it. 
Since l2 and l1 point to the same list object, any changes made to the list object through one variable are reflected when accessing it through the other variable.
Therefore, when print(l2) is executed, it prints the contents of the modified list object [1, 2, 3, 4].
