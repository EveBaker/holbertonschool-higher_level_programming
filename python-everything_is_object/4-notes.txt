In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

>>> a = 89
>>> b = a

yes

Yes. In the given code, a and b point to the same object.
When a = 89 is executed, a new integer object with the value 89 is created, and a is assigned to reference that object.
Then, b = a is executed, which assigns b to reference the same object that a is referencing. In this case, both a and b point to the same integer object with the value 89.

Therefore, the answer is Yes, a and b point to the same object.
