What do these 3 lines print?

>>> s1 = "Best School"
>>> s2 = "Best School"
>>> print(s1 == s2)

True

why is this true?
In the given code, s1 is assigned the string "Best School", and s2 is also assigned the string "Best School". Both s1 and s2 contain the same sequence of characters.
When print(s1 == s2) is executed, it compares the values of s1 and s2. Since both strings have the same content, the comparison evaluates to True.
