What does this script print?

a = (1)
b = (1)
a is b

True

why true? 
In Python, small integers are cached and reused for efficiency. 
When you assign the value 1 to both a and b, the interpreter reuses the same cached integer object for both variables. 
As a result, a is b returns True because they refer to the same object in memory.
