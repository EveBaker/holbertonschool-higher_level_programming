a = (1, )
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

Yes

why yes?
In Python, parentheses are used to define tuples. In the code a = (1, ), the value 1 is enclosed in parentheses, indicating that it is a tuple with a single element. 
The trailing comma after 1 is allowed and commonly used to differentiate a tuple with one element from a regular expression enclosed in parentheses.
Therefore, a is considered a tuple with one element, and the answer is "Yes".
