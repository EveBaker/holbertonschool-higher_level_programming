>>> a
[1, 2, 3]
>>> id (a)
139926795932424
>>> a += [4]
>>> id(a)
Will the last line of this script print 139926795932424? Answer with Yes or No.

Yes

why yes?
The initial value of a is a list [1, 2, 3], and its memory address (obtained using id(a)) is 139926795932424.
When you perform the operation a += [4], it modifies the existing list a in-place by appending 4 to it. Since the list is modified in-place, the memory address of a remains the same.
