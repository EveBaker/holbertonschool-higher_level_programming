What do these 3 lines print?

>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
>>> print(l1 is l2)

False

why is this false?
In the given code, l1 is assigned a list [1, 2, 3], and l2 is assigned a different list [1, 2, 3]. Although both l1 and l2 have the same elements in the same order, they are separate list objects in memory.
When print(l1 is l2) is executed, it checks for object identity using the is operator. Since l1 and l2 refer to different list objects, the comparison evaluates to False. 
The is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory, not just if their contents are equal.
In this case, l1 and l2 have the same elements, but they are distinct list objects, so l1 is l2 returns False.
