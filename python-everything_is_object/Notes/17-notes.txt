What does this script print?

def increment(n):
    n.append(4)

l = [1, 2, 3]
increment(l)
print(l)

[1, 2, 3, 4]

why is it printed?
In the given code, a function increment is defined, which takes a parameter n representing a list. Inside the function, the append method is used to add the value 4 to the list n.
Then, a list l is defined with the values [1, 2, 3]. When increment(l) is called, the list l is passed as an argument to the increment function. 
Since lists are mutable objects in Python, modifications made to the list object within the function are reflected outside the function as well.
Inside the increment function, the n.append(4) operation modifies the list object referred to by n by appending the value 4 to it. 
This modification affects the original list object l because both n and l refer to the same list object.
Therefore, when print(l) is executed after calling increment(l), it prints the modified list [1, 2, 3, 4]. The increment function modifies the list object l directly.
