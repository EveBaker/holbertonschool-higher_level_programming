What does this script print?

def increment(n):
    n += 1

a = 1
increment(a)
print(a)

1

why is it 1?
In the given code, a function increment is defined, which takes a parameter n and increments it by 1 using the += operator.
Then, a variable a is assigned the value 1. When increment(a) is called, the value of a is passed as an argument to the increment function.
However, integers in Python are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed.
Inside the increment function, the n += 1 operation creates a new integer object with the value 2 and assigns it to the local variable n. This does not modify the original integer object referred to by a.
Therefore, when print(a) is executed, it still prints the original value of a, which is 1. The increment function does not affect the value of a outside of the function.
