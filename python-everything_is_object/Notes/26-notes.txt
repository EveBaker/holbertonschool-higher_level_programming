What does this script print?

a = ()
b = ()
a is b

True

why True?
In Python, empty tuples, like a = () and b = (), are treated as singleton objects. This means that they refer to the same object in memory. 
Therefore, a is b checks for object identity and returns True because both a and b refer to the same empty tuple object.
