What do these 3 lines print?

>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = l1
>>> print(l1 is l2)

true

why is it true?
In the given code, l1 is assigned a list [1, 2, 3], and l2 is assigned the same list object as l1 using the assignment l2 = l1. Both l1 and l2 refer to the same list object in memory.
When print(l1 is l2) is executed, it checks for object identity using the is operator. Since l1 and l2 refer to the same list object, the comparison evaluates to True. 
The is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
In this case, l1 and l2 point to the same list object, so l1 is l2 returns True.
