a = (1)
Is a a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

No

why no?
In Python, parentheses are used for grouping expressions or to define tuples. 
However, when defining a tuple with only one element, a comma is required after the element to differentiate it from a regular expression enclosed in parentheses.
In the code a = (1), there is no comma after the element 1, so it is not recognized as a tuple. Instead, it is treated as a regular expression enclosed in parentheses. 
To define a tuple with a single element, the correct syntax would be a = (1,), where the comma after 1 indicates that it is a tuple with one element.
