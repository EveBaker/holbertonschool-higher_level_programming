In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

>>> a = 89
>>> b = a + 1

no

why is it no?
When a = 89 is executed, a new integer object with the value 89 is created, and a is assigned to reference that object.
Then, b = a + 1 is executed, which performs an addition operation (a + 1) and assigns the result to b. 
The addition operation creates a new integer object with the value 90, and b is assigned to reference this new object.
Therefore, a and b reference different integer objects, and they do not point to the same object.
