10. And with a list, is it equal
mandatory
What do these 3 lines print?

>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = [1, 2, 3] 
>>> print(l1 == l2)

True

why is it true?
In the given code, l1 is assigned a list [1, 2, 3], and l2 is assigned a different list [1, 2, 3]. Both l1 and l2 have the same elements in the same order.
When print(l1 == l2) is executed, it compares the values of l1 and l2. Since both lists have the same elements in the same order, the comparison evaluates to True. 
The == operator checks for equality between the elements of the lists.
Note that this comparison checks if the elements in the lists are equal, but it does not check if the lists refer to the same object in memory. 
In this case, l1 and l2 are different list objects, but their contents are equal, resulting in the comparison returning True.
